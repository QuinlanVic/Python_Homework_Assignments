#### Parameter vs Argument 
The major difference between parameters and arguments is that parameters are variables found within function declarations while arguments are the values passed to a function when it is invoked (called). Parameters act as placeholders and therefore do not have any concrete value upon creation whereas arguments are concrete values passed to functions. 

Arguments can be seen as the values that fill in the places that parameters defined in functions have assigned for them.

#### Functional programming concepts
- Currying = A curried function simulates accepting another input by returning a function to accept that input.
  - We curry a function by making it return a function to accept an input, instead of taking a single group of inputs. 
- Partial application = Partial application is the technique of binding part of the input of a function, while leaving the rest of the input to be specified later on.
  - We partially apply a function by binding part of its input, and leaving the rest of the input to be specified later.

### Forks in Github
Forks are copies of Github repositories that allow others to access and modify the repository's code. 
This means that the main repository is not changed. Others can however, send a pull request to the owner of the maing repository 
and with their permission they can allow changes to the main repository. 
- Forks are most commonly used to suggest changes to someone else's code or use someone else's code as a starting point/helpful resource for your own project.

### `git rebase -i`
